## Sarge (Master Sergeant Joseph Conrad)  

"Joseph Conrad is a tough, experienced soldier. He's one of the few people to have survived a large-scale Swarm invasion, an experience which forged him into the driven man he is today. A strong commander, he leads both by example, and through the not-so-gentle application of verbal foot to ass. He knows his team well and pushes hard to keep them at their best."

## Jaeger (Corporal Karl Jaeger) 

"Karl Jaeger is the son of the son of a corpsman, military to his war-hardened bones. He’s a hard-charging killing machine with a true warrior’s spirit. He believes in the soul-freeing joy of combat and has always suspected he'll die in the line of duty. And if that happens, well, he can’t imagine a better way to go."

## Wildcat (Private First Class Adele Lyon) 

"Growing up, Wildcat hadn’t anticipated following in the footsteps of her military family. In school, she’d dreamed of corporate life, business suits, a nice corner office. But the swarm took that away. Every able-bodied man and woman in her age cohort was funneled into hopeless defense of the colonies. By the time she was twenty-five, the cause was lost-- the colonies decimated, her family dead and scattered. Wildcat transferred into an elite unit to continue the fight."

## Wolfe (Private Thomas Wolfe) 

"Wolfe is an ex-con turned soldier. At his last sentencing, the judge gave him a choice: jail or the Interstellar Armed Forces. It was the chance he needed to turn his life around. He took top honors at boot camp, easily beating the other enlisted men at everything from hand-to-hand combat to special ordinance disassembly. When his sentence was up, he found that he not only liked military life, but was good at it--and was consequently offered a position in Special Ops."

## Faith (Corporal Eva Jensen) 

"Faith has the heart and soul of a medic. She's here to help people and believes in the Interstellar Armed Forces' mission to protect the Allied Systems against hostile alien assault. Despite having seen plenty of action, she’s still genuinely impacted by the human tragedy she sees and tends to take losses personally. She's deeply concerned for the welfare of her team."

## Bastille (Private Leon Bastille) 

"Leon Bastille was born on a prison world, child of a political prisoners; when political tides shifted, his family was released. It was a world run by black marketeers, where he learned basic medicine hands-on. He also received a strong, if informal, academic education (the prison being full of philosophers, authors, educators, poets and priests). Bastille is naturally suspicious of others, but also an excellent combat medic."

## Crash (Private David Murphy) 

"David Murphy, reputedly a child hacker genius at tech school, didn't take long to fall onto the wrong side of the law. At the age of 21, he was responsible for the notorious Starbase Systems Crash, allegedly costing the Trade Leagues millions in lost credits. Murphy is now serving time in the IAF as part of his sentence."

## Vegas (Private Alejandro Guerra) 

"Vegas has an almost savant-like talent for counting and memorization, a skill he put to use in various gambling houses where he won big at poker and blackjack tables. However, fortune is fickle, and after racking up massive debts and angering some important people, he had to get out. Vegas joined the IAF so he could earn the money to pay back his debts (or a sizeable seed fund with which to win back the rest), and to get away from people who want to crush his kneecaps."
