 | Swarm Bait | Meat Cake | A large chunk of synthetic meat soaked in Swarm pheromones. Will temporarily distract any nearby Swarm. | 
 | FG-01 Hand Grenades | Splash Damage | A set of high explosive cluster grenades. Marines with greater explosive skills are issued grenades with more cluster charges. | 
 | CR-18 Freeze Grenades | Large Radius | A set of highly explosive liquid nitrogen canisters. Each explosive is capable of temporarily freezing all aliens within its blast radius, rendering the aliens highly vulnerable to impacts. | 
 | MNV34 Nightvision Goggles | Rechargeable | Thermal based image intensifier with low signal to noise ratio and self-recharging power pack. The MNV34 is high resolution with a wide dynamic luminance range, making it suitable for all light conditions. Standard lightweight battery pack permits 10 seconds of continuous use. | 
 | Hand Welder | Seals and Unseals Doors | This IAF-issue handheld welder uses high temperature ionized plasma to create an effective cutting or welding arc, depending on the user specified setting. Generally used in the field to cut through or seal doors, offering the IAF marines a tactical advantage. | 
 | Flashlight Attachment | Tactical | A high intensity, self-recharging multi-bulb flashlight attachment, for providing targetted illumination at times of low visibility. | 
 | M478 Proximity Incendiary Mines | Fire Wall | A five piece set of M478 Proximity Incendiary Mines is standard issue for any NCO rank marine. These mines are placed and calibrated in the field and once activated will detonate when any creature matching target specifications comes near. Upon detonation, highly flammable napalm is released in a line to either side of the mine, both killing the victim and tactically denying the area to further foes. | 
 | ML30 Laser Trip Mine | Wall Mountable | A pack of attachable Laser Trip Mines. Detonation is triggered by any hostile entity breaking the detection beam. Marines skilled with explosives are able to place multiple mines with a single toss. | 
 | v45 Electric Charged Armor | Stops Infestation, Stuns | Activation of this marine armor's high voltage current stuns any attacker coming in contact with the suit, reduces incoming melee damage, and ejects infesting parasites from the armor surface. | 
 | L3A Tactical Heavy Armor | Up to 35% Damage Reduction, Passive | Wearing additional layered graphene armor plates improves resistance to all forms of damage. |
 | IAF Power Fist Attachment | Massive Damage Bonus on Combo Finisher | The Power Fist is an IAF developed combat suit attachment that boosts the damage of all melee attacks from the fist to the foot. | 
 | Displacement 'Blink' Pack | Rechargeable | An experimental device that instantly teleports the user to a nearby targeted location. Energy released at the entrance and exit points will stun nearby hostiles. Developed by the Enigma Research Group, this device is undergoing live IAF testing. | 
 | Short Range Assault Jets | Scatter Swarm | A limited use backpack attachment that can propel the marine into the air, allowing him to travel short distances and deliver high impact strikes. Manufactured by Premier Propulsion Research. | 
 | T75 Explosives | Door Buster | Demolitions explosive. After arming, retreat to minimum safe distance immediately. | 
 | X-33 Damage Amplifier | x2 Damage Aura | The weapons of all marines within the beacon radius are electromagnetically optimised to fire rounds with increased impact force. | 
 | Hornet Barrage | Homing Missile Attacks | Unleashes a salvo of auto-tracking explosive rockets. Marines with greater explosives training are authorized to carry more rockets in each cluster. | 
 | MTD6 Smart Bomb | Missile Storm, Single Use | Featuring a patented Multiple Threat Denial targeting system, the Smart Bomb is the ultimate single use one-to-many hostile elimination system. Activating this backpack mounted device will cause a continuous stream of auto tracking rockets to fire over a wide area. | 
 | IAF Personal Healing Kit | Single Use | A small individual healing kit for self-treatment of wounds in the field. Developed by SynTek Pharmaceutical Division. | 
 | Adrenaline | Temporary Slow Motion | A powerful injection fresh from the SynTek Pharmaceutical Division. In times of great danger, IAF troops can apply this adrenaline, giving themselves heightened reactions and perceptions. Metabolized completely within a matter of seconds, this drug can mean the difference between life and death in a tough spot, then leave a marine clear-headed and ready to proceed. | 
 | IAF Tesla Sentry Coil | Stuns In Radius | Self assembles into active defense, and self destructs when out power. Pulses high voltage arcs to stun nearby Swarm. | 
 | SM75 Combat Flares | Provides Auto-Aim Bonus | The SM75 Combat Flares are a special magnesium flare developed by the SynTek Megacorporation in conjunction with other standard issue firearms. In addition to providing light over an area, the flares also give out a key wavelength of reflective light which aids the targeting - allowing weapons to lock onto any foe caught in the magnesium glow. | 
 | TG-05 Gas Grenades | Corrosive Area Denial | A set of highly toxic gas grenades. Releases bio-hazard toxin upon detonation covering a small area with a cloud of gas. Anything remotely touching that area will liquefy and decompose at an extreme rate. Handling this material needs the standard medical bio-hazard manipulation certification. |
